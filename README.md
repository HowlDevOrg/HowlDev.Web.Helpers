## HowlDev.Web.Helpers.DbConnecter

This is a single class that has 4 methods that helps deal with thread pooling from Dapper. It is supposed to be used like the following: 

```csharp
public Task<IEnumerable<Account>> GetAllUsersAsync() =>
    conn.WithConnectionAsync(async conn => {
        var GetUsers = "select p.id, p.accountName, p.role from \"HowlDev.User\" p order by 1";
        try {
            return await conn.QueryAsync<Account>(GetUsers);
        } catch {
            return [];
        }
    }
);
```

This is a method that returns like a get call, with the important `conn.WithConnectionAsync(async conn => {...})` call. In my experience, you run into thread pool locking pretty quick, so it's best just to start by using this. 

AI happens to be pretty good at converting old calls into this format if you give it to them.

## HowlDev.Web.Helpers.WebSockets

This provides a WebSocketService class for use in APIs. This uses the simple WebSocket system provided by C# with no extra dependencies. It is designed as a single-service socket registration (`app.Map`) and sending messages to only those "subscribed" (which are the ones assigned to the service key). The entire system can be used by the sample code below. (Included in the TestingAPI in the WebSocket directory is a sample html page that displays the minimum requirement to use the socket).

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddWebSocketService<int>();

var app = builder.Build();
app.UseWebSockets();

app.Map("/ws/{id}", async (IWebSocketService service, HttpContext context, int id) => {
    await service.RegisterSocket(context, id);
});

app.MapGet("/post/{id}", async (IWebSocketService service, int id) => {
    await service.SendSocketMessage(id, $"This is the message: coming from id {id} at time {DateTime.Now}");
});

app.Run();
```

Add the WebSocketService with the key type in the Builder section, the _include the UseWebSockets middleware_, then just inject the service. I provided the interface that is generic (so you won't get type hints), but you can also request specific versions of the service by using types. So: 

```csharp
app.MapGet("/post/{id}", async (WebSocketService<int> service, int id) => {
    await service.SendSocketMessage(id, $"This is the message: coming from id {id} at time {DateTime.Now}");
});
```

I'm going to be looking into adding additional parts for the registration method to hopefully configure multiple services if needed, possibly as a group, but you should know that the only restriction for the type is that it is `notnull` (the only requirement for the dictionary keys). So you could theoretically use more complex objects to register sockets, but I would recommend the primitives `int` and `string`. 


## Changelog

1.1.0 (1/1/26)

- (Okay, I suppose you should read this version as missing the leading 1; I am still exploring what interface I want to make)
- BREAKING CHANGE: Removed the interface. I originally had it so you didn't have to specify types, but the number of endpoints that you end up dealing with the service is generally quite small, so I've removed that restriction. Now, you need to specify the types as seen in the test API: 

```csharp
app.Map("/ws/{id}", async (WebSocketService<int> service, HttpContext context, int id) => {
    await service.RegisterSocket(context, id);
});

app.MapGet("/post/{id}", async (WebSocketService<int> service, int id) => {
    await service.SendSocketMessage(id, $"This is the message: coming from id {id} at time {DateTime.Now}");
});
```

- This also makes differently-typed socket services more clear (and possible; the interface was a good extraction for 1 service, but if you need more, you'd have to strongly type anyways).
- IMPORTANT: Hooked into `IHostApplicationLifetime`, which allows me to force close sockets on close of the app, which was _super annoying_ for a time. Now, you close your app, and it closes all the sockets for you instead of having to go hunt down wherever you were debugging (forbid you ever deployed this library to production and couldn't shut down :P).

Forgot I accidentally published 1.0 before, so this is the first one I can publish that's actually meaningful.
